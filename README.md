### What it does

- Map a user journey step-by-step (one of the famous chevrons)
- store it in the browser (and also in G-Drive - along with an image you can share)
- add more info to each step (like: what does still need to be created to make that step smooth, by which team, etc.)
- (later): create instances of a journey & document/automate the flow along the journey with a specific customer
